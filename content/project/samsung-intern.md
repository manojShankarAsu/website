* Worked in the IMS-Media Team, the team that manages the Samsung VoLTE stack.
* Learnt the architecture of the IMS-Media Framework Client, the VoIP and its component protocols like Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), Real-time Transport Protocol(RTP), Real-time Transport Control Protocol(RTCP) etc.
* Learnt in detail the inner workings of a video call in Samsung mobile over LTE, ie the capturing of frames by the camera ,the processing and encoding of frames, sending frames in packets over the network, reception and decoding of raw frames of the video.
* Studied the various color models including RGB, YUV, YCbCr and implemented conversions of a frame from one color model to another in C language.
* Developed a new feature in the video chat application of Samsung S5 mobile, using which the members of the video chat can perform various effects on the other personâ€™s face like putting on goodies like hats, masks, moustaches, ornaments, fade-in, fade-out, rotate-right, rotate-left, change color tone of the live video stream, etc by applying the various image processing algorithms learnt providing a much more interactive live video chat experience for the users.
